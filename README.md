Data science project for 2025 IFTS course for ENGIM Artigianelli Torino

After loading the relevant python libraries and the dataset (which highlights the percentage of the population of every country on Earth that has access to electricity), I proceeded by exploring and modifying the dataset to change some data trypes for later use in mathematical operations and graph plotting.

Results can be summarized as follows:
- In around 60% of the world's countries, people have complete access to electricity.
- Asia, Oceania, North and South America have very high levels of access to electricity, however there are some outliers that have considerably less.
- Africa has the least median access to electricity, however there are no outliers as the range is very high (from around 20% to around 60%).
